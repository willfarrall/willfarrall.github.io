<!-- For this assignment, I have created an Interactive Photo Gallery based entirely around the 'Click' input.
The page splits into two primary sections and functions. The first is a 6x6 grid gallery, and the second is a popup image wrapper.
Style and functionality were considered, with the primary focus on making sure the CSS style always encourages the use of the 'Click' input.
While also making sure the entire functionality of the entire experience is focused on the same input -->

<!-- The Image Wrapper is the pop-up display that fills the site when an image is clicked. This is one of the two primary foundations of the site, with it
being the primary source of user feedback for the 'Click'. Good click-based interaction is based on effective user-based feedback and as such I wanted 
to make sure when the user clicks one of the images, a strong sense of feedback occurs. A larger expanded image takes up the screen is highly effective
in this regard. It also features a close button, which when clicked closes the popup. I wanted to add this to give the user a further sense of
input and control. -->
